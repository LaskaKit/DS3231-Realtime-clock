# LaskaKit DS3231 Real Time Clock

You can easily connect various sensors or OLED displays to LaskaKit boards, but you may be missing the ability to connect an RTC module. Now RTC module is here.

On the miniature board with the orginal DS3231 chip you will find the real time chip itself, two u≈†up connectors with I2C bus connection and also a header with I2C bus, power supply, output signal from RTC and backup power supply. There is a connector on the board for a CR1220 battery, this just serves as a backup power supply.
